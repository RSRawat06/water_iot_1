# water_iot_1
IoT based smart fisheries and water quality monitoring system and system. This is a low cost system for real time monitoring of the water quality in IOT. The system consist of several sensors is used to measuring physical and chemical parameters of the water. The parameters such as temperature, PH, turbidity, flow sensor of the water can be measured. The measured values from the sensors can be processed by the core controller. The Arduino  model can be  used as a core controller.  Finally, the sensor data can be viewed on internet using WI-FI system. User can monitor fisheries system using web and android apps. This System will help to increase the production of fisheries system.
